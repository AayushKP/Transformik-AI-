## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

```
All Pages Follow This Pattern:
├── Server Component (page.tsx)
│   ├── Server-side data fetching
│   ├── FAQs array (8 questions/answers)
│   └── Passes data to Client Component
│
└── Client Component (*Content.tsx)
    ├── Receives FAQs via props
    ├── Description section (when showDescription=true)
    ├── Interactive filters/sorting
    ├── FAQ Accordion display
    └── FAQ Schema component for SEO
```

### Props Added to Client Components

```typescript
interface Props {
  // ...existing props
  faqs?: { question: string; answer: string }[];
  showDescription?: boolean;
}
```

### New Imports Added

```typescript
import { FAQSchema } from "@/components/schema/FAQSchema";
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  AccordionContent,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion";
```
